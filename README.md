# PIC Microcontroller C-XC8 Based Keypad-LCD Calculator

The calculator project consists of three basic electronic components: PIC microcontroller, LCD screen and Keypad module. In this project, various PIC models were examined and the PIC16F873A model was preferred considering the number of digital pins, bus width, memory and price parameters. The operation of the system is based on the principle that the data received from the keypad is printed on the LCD screen as a result of four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) within the duty cycle. In the created electronic circuit, all the pins of the LCD screen are digital and connected to the PIC as output. The keypad, on the other hand, is connected to the PIC with row pins as digital-output and column pins as digital-input. Receiving the data from the keypad is provided by reading the column values ​​as a result of giving the logic 1 signal to the row pins, respectively. 16 different keys due to the 4x4 matrix of the keypad; It consists of 4 operators (+,-,*,/), 1 dot (.), 1 equals (=), and 10 digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). In addition, if the equals key is pressed for 3 seconds, the LCD screen is cleared.

PIC microcontroller is coded with C-XC8 programming language in MPLAB environment. Written algorithm has the ability to process arithmetic operations as decimal. If more than one operator is not allowed in the software, if numbers are not entered, the values are processed as zero as default, and if no operator is entered, "Incorrect entry!" precautions such as warning All the codes in the program, including the LCD and Keypad functions, were written by me and a unique software was used.
